# surfboard-scraper

A poorly written ruby script for scraping Moto/Arris Surfboard status page


## What does it do?

It scrapes the Surfboard status page (usually accessible at
http://192.168.100.1) and returns a JSON encoded string with all the juicy
details.  Currently the signal, address and log pages are scraped.
